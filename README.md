Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Alcides Manzo, a sophomore at MIT double majoring in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (6-5) and Mathematics (18).

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
Building SummerQuest, a full-stack platform that helps high school students discover and compare academic summer programs. I am building it using React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL, with features like AI-powered program scraping and in the future,personalized recommendations. Iâ€™m also developing a website for my fraternity, Zeta Psi, to improve member communication and event management.

**Visit summerquest.net to see the project!**

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
Advanced React concepts, backend best practices with Express.js and MySQL, authentication flows including JWT and OAuth. For electrical engineering, Iâ€™m expanding into C++ and C for embedded systems, and Altium Designer for PCB design and circuit development.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
Web applications, data-driven projects, and AI-powered tools â€” especially those that combine backend engineering and machine learning for real-world impact. Iâ€™m also interested in hardware-software integration projects.
